== Welcome to TestInternals

TestInternals patches Test::Unit::TestCase to allow testing of private methods,
as well as variables.

The stack trace is also available, including the ability to check
that specific parameter values were sent to a method.

It will also prevent the application from stopping tests if exit is called.
assert_alive and assert_dead have been included to assist in testing.

There are also a number of assertions that have been added.
